# Bubblemap Visualization Task: Planning Phase

## Task Overview

**Goal:** Create an interactive bubblemap visualization to represent wallet balances across multiple tokens and addresses.

**Status:** Planning Phase üìù

## What is a Bubblemap?

A bubblemap (also known as a bubble chart or bubble map) is a data visualization that displays three dimensions of data:
- Position (x and y coordinates)
- Size (bubble area/diameter)
- Color (optional fourth dimension)

For our wallet visualization, bubbles will represent:
- Individual wallets or wallet clusters
- Size corresponding to balance amounts
- Color indicating different tokens or token categories

## Planning Process

### 1. Data Requirements

#### Core Data Elements
- Wallet addresses
- ETH balances
- ERC20 token balances (potentially multiple tokens)
- Historical balance data (optional for time-series visualization)

#### Data Structure
- Create a standardized JSON format for the visualization data
- Define schema for representing wallet groups and hierarchies
- Establish normalization approach for comparing different tokens

#### Data Processing Needs
- Aggregation of similar wallets
- Filtering options (by balance threshold, token type)
- Sorting and grouping logic
- Outlier handling for extremely large balances

### 2. Visual Design Considerations

#### Layout Options
- Force-directed layout (bubbles organize naturally based on "forces")
- Grid-based layout (more structured, easier to compare)
- Hierarchical layout (showing relationships between wallets)

#### Interactive Elements
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Click interactions to drill down into specific wallets
- Animation for transitions between different views

#### Visual Encoding
- Size mapping: Linear vs. logarithmic scale for bubble sizes
- Color scheme: Categorical for tokens, sequential for balance ranges
- Opacity: Potentially represent activity levels
- Shape variations: Could indicate different wallet types

### 3. Technical Considerations

#### Data Processing Requirements
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Caching strategies for performance
- Progressive loading for large datasets

#### Performance Optimization
- Canvas vs. SVG rendering tradeoffs
- Data sampling for large wallet collections
- Level-of-detail adjustments based on zoom level

#### Extensibility
- Modular design for adding new visualization types
- Plugin architecture for custom metrics

### 4. User Experience Goals

#### Primary Use Cases
- Identifying wallet clusters with significant holdings
- Comparing distribution of different tokens
- Tracking changes in wallet balances over time
- Identifying outliers and unusual patterns

#### User Controls
- Time period selection
- Token filtering
- Balance thresholds
- Grouping controls
- Export and sharing options

#### Accessibility Considerations
- Color blindness accommodations
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Challenges
- Rendering performance with large datasets (1000+ wallets)
- Effective scaling between very large and very small balances
- Maintaining interactivity with complex visualizations

### Data Challenges
- Handling missing or incomplete data
- Normalizing values across different tokens
- Ensuring data freshness

## Next Steps

1. **Data exploration**
   - Analyze sample wallet data to understand distributions
   - Identify key metrics and dimensions for visualization

2. **Prototype sketching**
   - Create rough mockups of different visualization approaches
   - Evaluate different layout algorithms

3. **Define metrics**
   - Establish calculation methods for derived metrics
   - Define grouping and clustering algorithms

4. **Technical research**
   - Evaluate visualization libraries and frameworks
   - Benchmark performance with sample datasets

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Research and Web Planning
- Research visualization libraries
- Investigate web integration options
- Create detailed mockups
- Define technical architecture

### Phase 3: Development
- Implement core visualization components
- Integrate with wallet data sources
- Develop interactive features
- Test with real-world datasets
