# Wallet Visualization Project: Context Document

## Project Overview

This document provides context for the Wallet Visualization Project, which aims to create interactive visualizations for wallet balances across multiple tokens and addresses, with a focus on bubblemap visualization.

## Current Status

The project is currently in Phase 2: Web Research and Planning. We have completed the initial conceptual planning phase and are now researching web-based implementation options.

## Key Components Developed

1. **Wallet Collection Toolkit**
   - ETH and ERC20 balance multicall benchmark
   - Parallel wallet address generation
   - CLI for checking wallet balances

2. **Visualization Planning**
   - Bubblemap conceptual planning (Phase 1)
   - Web visualization research and planning (Phase 2)

## Project Structure

- `wallet_balance_cli.ts`: Command-line tool for checking ETH and token balances
- `modules/wallet_generator.ts`: Wallet generation functionality
- `modules/wallet_worker.ts`: Worker file for parallel wallet address derivation
- `bubblemap_task.md`: Planning document for bubblemap visualization
- `bubblemap_phase2.md`: Web research and planning for visualization
- `context.md`: This document, providing project context

## Next Steps

1. Select appropriate visualization library based on research
2. Develop technical prototype with sample wallet data
3. Define detailed component architecture
4. Implement data processing pipeline
