## RPC Performance Characteristics

- **Linear Scaling**: Response time increases linearly with wallet count
- **Throughput Peak**: ~2,300 requests/second achieved at around 2,500 wallets
- **No Breaking Point**: RPC endpoint handled all tested wallet counts without failure
- **Batch Size Pattern**: Larger wallet counts benefited from larger batch sizes

## Conclusions

1. **Base RPC is highly capable**:
   - Successfully processed 5,000+ wallet balances in a single multicall
   - No failures observed at this scale, suggesting significant headroom
   - Response times remained reasonable even at high wallet counts

2. **Performance scaling is efficient**:
   - Response time scales roughly linearly with wallet count
   - Throughput (req/s) peaks around 2,300 requests/second
   - At scale, the multicall optimizes RPC usage significantly 

3. **Batch size impact is significant**:
   - Different batch sizes showed varying efficiency at different scales
   - Smaller batches (1024-2048) performed better for <1000 addresses
   - Medium batches (4096) performed best at 1000-3000 addresses
   - Larger batches (8192) performed best at >3000 addresses

4. **Parallel wallet generation is crucial**:
   - Multi-threaded generation reduced setup time by 8.5x
   - Scales effectively with available CPU cores
   - Processing 10,000 addresses took just 7.19 seconds

## Recommended Settings

### For Production Use

- **Optimal Batch Size by Wallet Count**:
  - <500 wallets: 1024 bytes
  - 500-1000 wallets: 2048 bytes
  - 1000-3000 wallets: 4096 bytes
  - 3000+ wallets: 8192 bytes

- **Wallet Generation**:
  - Use all available CPU cores (WORKER_COUNT=CPU_CORES)
  - Set WALLET_BATCH_SIZE=100 for optimal performance
  - Enable parallel processing for any operations with >500 wallets

- **RPC Configuration**:
  - Timeout: 60 seconds minimum for large requests
  - Retry Strategy: 3 retries with 1-second backoff
  - Rate Limiting: Base RPC seems to handle large-scale requests well,
    but production systems should implement backoff strategies

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implement fallback logic for occasional RPC timeouts
  - Consider breaking extremely large requests (>5000 wallets) into chunks
  - Monitor RPC health with small test requests before large operations

### For Testing/Development

- **Quick Tests**:
  - Use 1024 byte batch size for quick tests
  - Limit test wallet count to 500 for rapid iteration

- **Benchmarking**:
  - START_WALLET_COUNT=50
  - WALLET_COUNT_INCREMENT=50
  - MAX_WALLET_COUNT depends on test purpose
  - RETRY_COUNT=3
  - Run with --detailed flag for comprehensive logs

## Next Steps

- Further investigation into higher wallet counts (5,000-10,000+)
- Testing on different RPC providers for comparison
- Implementing automated batch size selection based on wallet count
- Exploring multicall optimization techniques (chunking, parallelization)
