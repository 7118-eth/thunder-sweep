# ‚ö° ThunderSweep ‚ö°

The **fastest** publicly available multi-wallet management solution, built with TypeScript and Deno. ThunderSweep leverages multi-threading (JS Workers) and multicall technology to achieve unparalleled performance for massive wallet operations.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîë Load seed phrases from environment variables
- üëõ Derive multiple wallet addresses per seed phrase at lightning speed
- üíæ Store addresses in Deno KV for persistence
- üìä Benchmark wallet derivation performance (up to ~1140 wallets/second)
- üöÄ Test RPC limits with ETH balance multicall benchmark
- üßµ Multi-threaded architecture using Deno Workers for maximum performance
- ‚öôÔ∏è Optimized multicall implementation for gathering balances

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed (version 1.36.0 or newer)
- Access to a EVM network RPC endpoint

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with your seed phrases, RPC URL, and token address:

```
SEED_PHRASE_1="your test seed phrase here with twelve words or more"
SEED_PHRASE_2="another seed phrase if needed for testing multiple"
RPC_URL="https://your-base-rpc-endpoint"
TOKEN_ADDRESS="0xYourTokenAddress"  # Required when checking token balances
# Optional: Multiple token addresses
# TOKEN_ADDRESSES="0xFirstTokenAddress,0xSecondTokenAddress,0xThirdTokenAddress"
```

## Usage

### Wallet Derivation

Derive wallet addresses from seed phrases and store in Deno KV:

```bash
# Sequential version
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read seed_wallets.ts

# Parallel version (multi-threaded)
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read seed_wallets_parallel.ts
```

### ETH Balance Multicall Benchmark

Test how many wallet ETH balances can be fetched in a single multicall before the RPC endpoint breaks:

```bash
# Basic benchmark
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write eth_balance_multicall_benchmark.ts

# With CSV export
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write eth_balance_multicall_benchmark.ts --csv

# With detailed output
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write eth_balance_multicall_benchmark.ts --detailed
```

#### Benchmark Configuration

The ETH balance benchmark can be configured via environment variables:

```
# Optional configuration
START_WALLET_COUNT=50
MAX_WALLET_COUNT=10000
WALLET_COUNT_INCREMENT=50
RETRY_COUNT=3
WORKER_COUNT=8     # Number of CPU threads to use (defaults to CPU core count)
WALLET_BATCH_SIZE=100   # Wallet addresses per batch
```

You can also override batch sizes with:

```
BATCH_SIZE_1024=1000  # Override the 1024-byte batch size to 1000
BATCH_SIZE_2048=2000  # etc.
```

## üî• Performance

### Wallet Derivation Performance

- **Sequential:** ~130 wallets/second
- **Parallel (16 cores):** ~1140 wallets/second (8.5x faster than single-threaded alternatives)

### ETH Balance Multicall

Our optimized multicall implementation can process thousands of wallet balances in a single request, dramatically outperforming traditional one-by-one API calls by up to 100x.

## üß™ Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
deno test --allow-net --allow-env
```
