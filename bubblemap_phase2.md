# Bubblemap Visualization: Web Research & Planning (Phase 2)

## Overview

This document outlines the research and planning for implementing the bubblemap visualization in a web environment, building upon the conceptual planning from Phase 1.

**Status:** Research & Web Planning üîç

## Web Visualization Libraries Research

### D3.js
- **Pros**: Extremely powerful and flexible; the gold standard for custom web visualizations
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve; more code required for basic implementations
- **Bubble chart capabilities**: Excellent support for force-directed layouts and complex interactions
- **Performance with large datasets**: Good, but requires manual optimization
- **Examples**: [D3 Bubble Chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-chart), [Force-Directed Graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph)

### Three.js
- **Pros**: 3D rendering capabilities; leverages WebGL for high performance
- **Cons**: Overkill for 2D visualizations; more complex than necessary for basic bubble charts
- **Bubble chart capabilities**: Not specifically designed for data visualization but can create impressive 3D bubble effects
- **Performance with large datasets**: Excellent for rendering thousands of objects
- **Examples**: [Three.js Bubble Visualization](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_buffergeometry_drawrange)

### Chart.js
- **Pros**: Simple API; easier learning curve; built-in responsiveness
- **Cons**: Less customizable; limited advanced features
- **Bubble chart capabilities**: Basic bubble chart support; limited interaction options
- **Performance with large datasets**: Moderate; struggles with 1000+ data points
- **Examples**: [Chart.js Bubble](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bubble.html)

### ECharts
- **Pros**: Rich feature set; good performance; simpler than D3 but more flexible than Chart.js
- **Cons**: Larger package size; less community support than D3
- **Bubble chart capabilities**: Good built-in support for bubble charts with sizing and coloring
- **Performance with large datasets**: Good optimization for large datasets
- **Examples**: [ECharts Bubble Chart](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=bubble-gradient)

### Plotly.js
- **Pros**: High-level API; interactive by default; good documentation
- **Cons**: Larger bundle size; not as performance-focused
- **Bubble chart capabilities**: Built-in bubble chart type with good customization options
- **Performance with large datasets**: Moderate; has optimization features but not as fast as D3+Canvas
- **Examples**: [Plotly Bubble Charts](https://plotly.com/javascript/bubble-charts/)

## Technical Architecture Planning

### Data Pipeline
1. **Data Loading**: 
   - Fetch wallet data from API endpoints
   - Support for large dataset pagination or streaming
   - Caching strategies for improved performance

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Backend pre-processing vs. client-side processing tradeoffs
   - Aggregation and filtering strategies
   - Data normalization for different token types

3. **Data Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "wallets": [
       {
         "address": "0x123...",
         "balances": {
           "eth": 1.25,
           "token1": 500.0, 
           "token2": 10.5
         },
         "lastActivity": "2023-04-15T10:30:00Z",
         "cluster": "whale"
       }
     ],
     "metadata": {
       "tokens": {
         "token1": {
           "name": "ExampleToken",
           "symbol": "EXT",
           "decimals": 18
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Web Application Structure
1. **Frontend Framework Options**:
   - React: Good integration with D3, component-based structure
   - Vue: Reactivity system works well with dynamic visualizations
   - Svelte: Less overhead, good performance

2. **Rendering Strategy**:
   - SVG: Better for smaller datasets (<500 elements), easier interaction
   - Canvas: Better for larger datasets (>500 elements), faster rendering
   - WebGL: For very large datasets (>5000 elements) or 3D visualizations

3. **Responsive Design Approach**:
   - Adaptive visualization sizing for different screen sizes
   - Feature adaptation based on device capabilities
   - Mobile-specific interaction patterns

## User Interface Design Considerations

### Layout Sketches
- Main visualization area with filters and controls panel
- Detail view for selected wallet information
- Timeline controls for historical data (if implemented)
- Legend and context information

### Key Interactions
- Zooming and panning (mouse wheel, pinch-to-zoom)
- Selecting individual bubbles for details
- Filtering controls (by token, balance range)
- Switching between different visualization modes

### Accessibility Planning
- Keyboard navigation for key functions
- Screen reader support for data points
- Alternative views for color-blind users
- Text-based data table as an alternative view

## Performance Optimization Research

### Data Loading Strategies
- Progressive loading for large datasets
- Server-side aggregation for initial view
- Lazy loading additional details as needed

### Rendering Optimizations
- Canvas-based rendering for large datasets
- WebWorkers for background data processing
- Throttling updates during animations/transitions

### Browser Compatibility
- Target browsers and fallback strategies
- Feature detection and polyfills

## Technical Prototyping Plan

1. **Simple Proof of Concept**:
   - Basic D3.js implementation with static dataset
   - Test different layout algorithms
   - Evaluate performance with varying dataset sizes

2. **Performance Benchmark**:
   - Compare rendering speed across libraries
   - Test with synthetic large datasets (1000-10000 wallets)
   - Identify bottlenecks

3. **Interaction Prototype**:
   - Implement core interactions (zoom, select, filter)
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Gather feedback on usability

## Next Steps

1. **Select visualization library** based on research findings
2. **Create technical prototype** with sample wallet data
3. **Define detailed component architecture** for the chosen framework
4. **Develop data fetching and processing strategy**
5. **Document API requirements** for the backend services
